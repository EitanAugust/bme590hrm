# bme590hrm

Package to create an hrm (heart rate monitor)
 class, that finds useful data when a heartrate ECG
.csv file is input. The attributes calculated include heart rate in bpm,
the minimum and maximum voltages of the ECG, the duration of the signal,
the number of heart beats and the times at which beats occur.  The input
csv file should have two columns; the first is time data and the second is 
voltage data.
